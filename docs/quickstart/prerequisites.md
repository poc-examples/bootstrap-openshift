# Prerequisites

Under the hood this bootstrapper runs using a [container](Dockerfile).  The container contains all of the versioned software required to run the bootstrapping processes. 

## Requirements

- Supported OS: Linux

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)

Once requirements are met you can pull the source files and build your cluster. See [Getting Started](getting-started.md)
