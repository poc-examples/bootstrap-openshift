# Quickstart Guide

Cluster Bootstrapper is a github repo that sets up a running openshift cluster and launches demos from [Workshops](https://github.com/poc-examples/workshops) that uses the [rollout-controller helm chart](https://github.com/poc-examples/charts/tree/main/charts/rollout-controller).

These charts are constructed to work together for the purpose of providing a quick demostration platform for previewing Red Hat OpenShift related products and should not be regarded as best practices.

This is currently: **pre-alpha**
